Update:
As of 3/10/21,
The script has been deprecated. Linkedin's API is severely throttling the number of responses. 

Example script to scrape linkedin job postings
For more context about this script, you can check out my [post](https://tariq101.netlify.app/scraping-linkedin/)

You will first need to install linkedin-jobs-scraper:

`pip install linkedin-jobs-scraper`

then run the script:

`python main.py`

I like to redirect the standard output to a file for persistence: 

`python main.py >> output`
